What is one of the bravest thing you have done? I was 14, and walking home from school. A well-dressed man who looked like he was in his early 20s was walking towards me. I was lost in my own thoughts when I was walking, and as our paths crossed, he reached out and groped my chest. The moment this happened, I was confused for a second and stood frozen to the ground, not knowing how to react. I wheeled back, only to see the guy walking away casually, sniggering. He didn't even run, because he assumed I wouldn't do much. I threw my only weapon, a 500 ml nearly-empty plastic water bottle aimed straight for his head. My aim being so excellent, it went a few metres past his head, and he ended up tripping on the bottle, falling to the ground. I ran up to him, landed good kicks in his groin, screamed, called for help. Some people stopped their cars, asked me if I was alright, landed punches on him, verbally abused him, and even offered him advice. He ended up in tears and apologized. People talked me out of filing an FIR because they said it would be a hassling affair. I believed it and moved on. One less pervert in the world.
I had a friend who worked as a flight attendant and she got into a mild argument with a guy who insisted on having EVERYTHING that was free or complimentary on the flight. He was highly annoying and constantly asked crew for stuff. If he saw someone next to him get something, he wanted it too. At one point during the flight a lady asked for a sanitary pad to help her with an 'emergency' situation. He insisted he should have one too - cos you know, it's free, right? My friend tried to reason with him. I'm not sure if his English was 100%, because he insisted again and seemed to assume the pad was one of these... A sleep mask.??? Upon receiving his sanitary pad he proceeded to peel the paper backing off and expose the sticky side; he stuck the thing over his eyes and soon afterwards fell asleep... THE END.
Do you know if you switched a chicken egg with that of a duck without the hen noticing, what would happen? My dad grew up farming banty chickens and ducks. Banty chickens are excellent and responsible egg layers, and will not give up until their eggs hatch. When they have a “miscarriage”, they just don't stop trying to lay them. Ducks, on the other hand, quickly loose interest in laying their eggs and wander off. In order to sustain the ducks, my dad’s job was to collect duck eggs and place them under banty chickens. When they hatched, the banty chickens couldn't tell the difference. But the poor ducklings had a hard time understanding “mom”. Banty chickens dart around eating insects; the ducklings’ natural instinct is to follow their mother in a neat line. Now imagine a bunch of ducklings trying to make a neat line behind their difficult to follow, zigzagging mother. Oh, and then comes drinking from the pond. A banty chicken will lead her chicks to the pond, and everyone takes a few sips and then proceeds darting about after insects. When a duck goes to the pond with her ducklings, they all just wade in and sip water as they swim around. Now when a banty chicken with ducklings leads everyone to the pond for a few sips of water, all the ducklings instinctively wade in and start swimming around. The poor mother, unaware of her children's swimming abilities, then flips out and runs in circles around the pond frantically clucking at them. All the while, the ducklings swim around wondering “What's up with mom?”.
This is a story about a lovely thing a child has said. Do you know the marshmallow test? You give a child a marshmallow, and then say that if she (Layla, in this case) could keep from eating it for 10 minutes, you'll give her a second. So I tried that test with my granddaughter (not with marshmallows, but with chocolate, which she likes much more). According to extensive experiments, children who "pass" the "marshmallow test" are far more successful in later life. They have learned a fundamental truth in life, that delayed gratification can lead to a far better long-term outcome. She sat and watched the chocolate. The 10-minute hourglass finally emptied, and she had succeeded. She asked for her second piece of chocolate.  I gave it to her, and she now had two in her hand. That's when she looked up at me and asked, "Would you like one, Grandpa?". Needless to say, from that moment on I would readily give my life for her.
This story is about the biggest tip that you have ever received as an employee? I’m 21 years old and working at Fridays. One night this woman comes in with three small children. As a waiter, I could usually tell who is going to tip well and who is going tip not at all. I definitely got the latter vibe from her. She asked about the price of everything on the menu, she ordered only water to drink. She wasn’t interested in appetizers. At one point her daughter asked her (very politely) if she could have milk. The woman pulled out her coin purse and counted up her change before saying yes. Now I am convinced I’m not getting a tip, but they were very nice and pleasant to serve so I don’t even think twice about it. At the end of the meal she paid entirely in quarters. When I went back to bus the table, to my surprise, there was a stack of quarters left for me. It amounted to $8, or about 25% of the meal. Here was a woman who had to count her money before ordering her daughter a chocolate milk because she wanted to make sure she still had enough to tip me generously. Was it the largest tip I ever got? No, but it’s the only one I remember all these years later.
What is the most soul-satisfying thing you have ever done in your life? My mentor, the great Nobel Laureate Luis Alvarez was dying of cancer, but I could tell that he was more concerned about his mental state. I assured him his wits were all there, but he had watched his dad suffer from Alzheimers, and he didn’t seem convinced. Then I stumbled upon a small optical device, a display that used an array of tiny lenses to produce a wonderful and beautiful Moire pattern. That was all I could figure out about it; just exactly how did it really work? I knew that Alvarez had an enormous understanding of classical optics, and he loved the subject. So I brought him the device, told him about my Moire thoughts, but expressed my confusion. He took it from my hand, examined it, showed fascination, puzzlement, and said he would think about it. I left it with him. Two days later I visited again, and he proudly explained to me how it worked. I was delighted, but (I think) not as delighted as he was. He knew the problem was challenging; he knew I had tried and failed to understand it. He had figured out its clever and non-intuitive design. Nothing less than that could have convinced him that his mental abilities were undiminished. I still take pleasure in my memory of the joy that brought to him.
A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, “I’ll give each of you just one wish” “Me first! Me first!” says the administration clerk. “I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” Poof! She’s gone. “Me next! Me next!” says the sales rep. “I want to be in Hawaii,relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.” Poof! He’s gone. “OK, you’re up,” the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, “I want those two back in the office after lunch.”
What are some dumb questions you have been asked? My girlfriend and I went to watch Avatar when it was released. Apparently, it was her first 3D movie experience and God was she excited. When she came out of the theater, visibly overwhelmed, she asked me, "Don't you think the world would be much more beautiful if we could see it in 3D?". I drank myself to death that night.
What are some dumb questions you have been asked? Each time you board a plane and look for your seat, a small part of you is begging to be seated beside someone interesting. After spending hours of flying besides snoring, noisy and boring old people, this time I finally found a skinny girl in her mid twenties seated beside me. For once I was seated with someone who smelled nice, had skinny elbows, and seemed likely to stay up during the flight. As soon as the safety belt sign went off, she took out her brand new "laminated" laptop with Windows 8 and started fiddling with it. After hopelessly struggling with it for over ten minutes, she turned to me, "Excuse me, can you help me out with this?". "Of course, What is it?", always interested to play around with the then newly released Windows 8. "I am unable to catch wi-fi signals on this?". I look at her, with all my shock and horror clearly visible on my face, "We're 30,000 ft. up in the air, how on earth would you get wi-fi here??". But she thought she was wiser, and chose to say something, which almost made me smash my head on her laptop, "But my laptop has "airplane mode", Wi-fi should work in airplanes, No?". I had just hit the rock bottom of tech-lowness in my life, and in that flight, I chose to sleep, instead.
What is the best thing that has ever happened to you for being nice?  I was chatting with a stranger at a party; he was very curious about physics. It was time to sit down and eat, and several of my friends urged me to take a seat with them; but there was only one seat. I thought it would be rude to leave my conversation, so I declined and sat with the stranger I had been talking to. We continued to talk through the lunch. Then, at the end, he said, "I assume you get all the financial support you need from the federal government." I said no; because my kind of research was typically in fields that they didn't support. He continued, "I run a small family foundation. Could we help support your research?" That was 15 years ago, and his foundation has given us substantial help every year.
What did someone do that made you think they were really smart? When I was in high school our physics teacher gave us a challenge that involved making a paper air plane of any shape. The only objective was to get it to fly as far as possible. I had some paper air plane making skills so I made the best plane I could and it flew pretty far. One guy made the greatest, yet simplest paper airplane of all time. He stood there at the starting line with a regular piece of paper. Some classmates scratched their head while silently chuckling to themselves. Moments later he took the flat piece of paper, crumpled it up, and threw it down the hall way. He beat the class with ease. Some of the students got mad and said that he cheated. The physics teacher said, "How so? I said it could be any shape. A paper ball is indeed a shape.". He won the contest with flying colors. "Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see." — Arthur Schopenhauer. I still regard this classmate as a genius.
A navy captain is alerted by his First Mate that there is a pirate ship coming towards his position. He asks a sailor to get him his red shirt.  The captain was asked, “Why do you need a red shirt?” The Captain replies, “So that when I bleed, you guys don’t notice and aren’s discouraged.” They fight off the pirates eventually. The very next day, the Captain is alerted that 50 pirate ships are coming towards their boat. He yells, “Get me my brown pants!”
A couple going on vacation but his wife was on a business trip so he went to the destination first and his wife would meet him the next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick email. Unfortunately, when typing her address, he mistyped a letter and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher’s wife whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her email, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint. At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen: Dearest Wife, Just got checked in. Everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow. P.S. Sure is hot down here.
3 men died and went up to heaven. The guy at the gate said “The better you were to your wife, the better kind of car you’ll get.” The first guy was very loyal to his wife and got a Ferrari. The second man fought with his wife so he got a broken down car. The last guy cheated on his wife dozens of times so he got a scooter. One day the guy on the scooter saw the guy in the Ferrari crying. He asked him, “Why are you crying?” He answered, “I just saw my wife on roller skates.”
In 1821, the Ottoman empire is occuping Greece. In the middle of one battle the Turks ran out of bullets and proposed to destroy the Acropolis to use the lead cores of its columns to make ammunition. When the Greeks got wind of this they gathered up their bullets and sent them to the Turks to use against themselves.
It is 1938. Walt Disney Studios are having a great succes because of the releas of first feature-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. But women rights are not having so much success yet. Here's the answer to a woman's application. Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen as that is performed entirely by young men, the letter explains. The only work open to women consists of tracing the characters on clear celluloid sheets with Indian ink and filling in the tracings on the reverse side with point according to directions. However, as the letter goes on: "It would not be advisable to come to Hollywood with the above specifically in view, as there are really very few openings in comparison with the number of girls who apply."
My ex-boyfriend's mom had her eye make-up tattooed on, and sent her kids (who lived with her at the time) to the store for a couple of things. It wasn't until my ex and his brother were in the check-out line, receiving funny looks from the clerk, that he realized that they were two lone men buying nothing but cucumbers and vaseline (which his mom wanted to soothe the swelling from her eyes). My ex panics and blurts out, "No, it's okay, he's my brother!" while gesturing to his brother. They received major ಠ_ಠ faces. He just stopped talking, figured there was nothing he could do to salvage the situation, and just accepted the judgment.
We were flying to CA while I was breastfeeding our second daughter, Lucy. I had a bottle of breastmilk with me that the flight attendant graciously heated for me. I was standing in the galley and uncapped the bottle. Because of pressure some milk squirted out and sprayed a businessman waiting for the bathroom. It got on his hand. He shrugged, smiled and then LICKED IT OFF. He said, "Yum, just right!" and had no idea it was my breastmilk. I just about wet my pants. What a nice man!
I am a white american woman. I was engaged with an African-American man and I got pregnant. We broke up. I had many thoughts about whether keeping the baby or not. Many reasons were making me doubt about what to do. Especially, I am well aware about the prejuduces so common in the white american community in which I live. My son will be half-black. Prejudices around him will make his life hard and I won't be able to transmit him the beautiful African America culture that he should have access to. I'm sure his dad won't be able to raise him alone in another community. I decided to give him for adoption. The dad strongly disagrees. But I prefer him to live in a welcoming African-American family, rather than in my culture full stereotypes and hate.
