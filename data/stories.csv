I was 14, and walking home from school. A well-dressed man who looked like he was in his early 20s was walking towards me. I was lost in my own thoughts when I was walking, and as our paths crossed, he reached out and groped my chest. The moment this happened, I was confused for a second and stood frozen to the ground, not knowing how to react. I wheeled back, only to see the guy walking away casually, sniggering. He didn't even run, because he assumed I wouldn't do much. I threw my only weapon, a 500 ml nearly-empty plastic water bottle aimed straight for his head. My aim being so excellent, it went a few metres past his head, and he ended up tripping on the bottle, falling to the ground. I ran up to him, landed good kicks in his groin, screamed, called for help. Some people stopped their cars, asked me if I was alright, landed punches on him, verbally abused him, and even offered him advice. He ended up in tears and apologized. People talked me out of filing an FIR because they said it would be a hassling affair. I believed it and moved on. One less pervert in the world.
I had a friend who worked as a flight attendant and she got into a mild argument with a guy who insisted on having EVERYTHING that was free or complimentary on the flight. He was highly annoying and constantly asked crew for stuff. If he saw someone next to him get something, he wanted it too. At one point during the flight a lady asked for a sanitary pad to help her with an 'emergency' situation. He insisted he should have one too - cos you know, it's free, right?. My friend tried to reason with him. I'm not sure if his English was 100%, because he insisted again and seemed to assume the pad was one of these... A sleep mask. Upon receiving his sanitary pad he proceeded to peel the paper backing off and expose the sticky side; he stuck the thing over his eyes and soon afterwards fell asleep... THE END.
Do you know if you switched a chicken egg with that of a duck without the hen noticing, what would happen?. My dad grew up farming banty chickens and ducks. Banty chickens are excellent and responsible egg layers, and will not give up until their eggs hatch. When they have a “miscarriage”, they just don't stop trying to lay them. Ducks, on the other hand, quickly loose interest in laying their eggs and wander off. In order to sustain the ducks, my dad’s job was to collect duck eggs and place them under banty chickens. When they hatched, the banty chickens couldn't tell the difference. But the poor ducklings had a hard time understanding “mom”. Banty chickens dart around eating insects; the ducklings’ natural instinct is to follow their mother in a neat line. Now imagine a bunch of ducklings trying to make a neat line behind their difficult to follow, zigzagging mother. Oh, and then comes drinking from the pond. A banty chicken will lead her chicks to the pond, and everyone takes a few sips and then proceeds darting about after insects. When a duck goes to the pond with her ducklings, they all just wade in and sip water as they swim around. Now when a banty chicken with ducklings leads everyone to the pond for a few sips of water, all the ducklings instinctively wade in and start swimming around. The poor mother, unaware of her children's swimming abilities, then flips out and runs in circles around the pond frantically clucking at them. All the while, the ducklings swim around wondering “What's up with mom?”.
This is a story about a lovely thing a child has said. Do you know the marshmallow test? You give a child a marshmallow, and then say that if she (Layla, in this case) could keep from eating it for 10 minutes, you'll give her a second. So I tried that test with my granddaughter (not with marshmallows, but with chocolate, which she likes much more). According to extensive experiments, children who "pass" the "marshmallow test" are far more successful in later life. They have learned a fundamental truth in life, that delayed gratification can lead to a far better long-term outcome. She sat and watched the chocolate. The 10-minute hourglass finally emptied, and she had succeeded. She asked for her second piece of chocolate.  I gave it to her, and she now had two in her hand. That's when she looked up at me and asked, "Would you like one, Grandpa?". Needless to say, from that moment on I would readily give my life for her.
I’m 21 years old and working at Fridays. One night this woman comes in with three small children. As a waiter, I could usually tell who is going to tip well and who is going tip not at all. I definitely got the latter vibe from her. She asked about the price of everything on the menu, she ordered only water to drink. She wasn’t interested in appetizers. At one point her daughter asked her (very politely) if she could have milk. The woman pulled out her coin purse and counted up her change before saying yes. Now I am convinced I’m not getting a tip, but they were very nice and pleasant to serve so I don’t even think twice about it. At the end of the meal she paid entirely in quarters. When I went back to bus the table, to my surprise, there was a stack of quarters left for me. It amounted to $8, or about 25% of the meal. Here was a woman who had to count her money before ordering her daughter a chocolate milk because she wanted to make sure she still had enough to tip me generously. Was it the largest tip I ever got? No, but it’s the only one I remember all these years later.
My mentor, the great Nobel Laureate Luis Alvarez was dying of cancer, but I could tell that he was more concerned about his mental state. I assured him his wits were all there, but he had watched his dad suffer from Alzheimers, and he didn’t seem convinced. Then I stumbled upon a small optical device, a display that used an array of tiny lenses to produce a wonderful and beautiful Moire pattern. That was all I could figure out about it; just exactly how did it really work? I knew that Alvarez had an enormous understanding of classical optics, and he loved the subject. So I brought him the device, told him about my Moire thoughts, but expressed my confusion. He took it from my hand, examined it, showed fascination, puzzlement, and said he would think about it. I left it with him. Two days later I visited again, and he proudly explained to me how it worked. I was delighted, but (I think) not as delighted as he was. He knew the problem was challenging; he knew I had tried and failed to understand it. He had figured out its clever and non-intuitive design. Nothing less than that could have convinced him that his mental abilities were undiminished. I still take pleasure in my memory of the joy that brought to him.
A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, “I’ll give each of you just one wish”. “Me first, Me first!” says the administration clerk. “I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world”. Poof! She’s gone. “Me next, Me next!” says the sales rep. “I want to be in Hawaii,relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life”. Poof! He’s gone. “OK, you’re up,” the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, “I want those two back in the office after lunch.”
My girlfriend and I went to watch Avatar when it was released. Apparently, it was her first 3D movie experience and God was she excited. When she came out of the theater, visibly overwhelmed, she asked me, "Don't you think the world would be much more beautiful if we could see it in 3D?". I drank myself to death that night.
Each time you board a plane and look for your seat, a small part of you is begging to be seated beside someone interesting. After spending hours of flying besides snoring, noisy and boring old people, this time I finally found a skinny girl in her mid twenties seated beside me. For once I was seated with someone who smelled nice, had skinny elbows, and seemed likely to stay up during the flight. As soon as the safety belt sign went off, she took out her brand new "laminated" laptop with Windows 8 and started fiddling with it. After hopelessly struggling with it for over ten minutes, she turned to me, "Excuse me, can you help me out with this?". "Of course, What is it?", always interested to play around with the then newly released Windows 8. "I am unable to catch wi-fi signals on this?". I look at her, with all my shock and horror clearly visible on my face, "We're 30,000 ft. up in the air, how on earth would you get wi-fi here??". But she thought she was wiser, and chose to say something, which almost made me smash my head on her laptop, "But my laptop has "airplane mode", Wi-fi should work in airplanes, No?". I had just hit the rock bottom of tech-lowness in my life, and in that flight, I chose to sleep, instead.
I was chatting with a stranger at a party; he was very curious about physics. It was time to sit down and eat, and several of my friends urged me to take a seat with them; but there was only one seat. I thought it would be rude to leave my conversation, so I declined and sat with the stranger I had been talking to. We continued to talk through the lunch. Then, at the end, he said, "I assume you get all the financial support you need from the federal government". I said no; because my kind of research was typically in fields that they didn't support. He continued, "I run a small family foundation; Could we help support your research?". That was 15 years ago, and his foundation has given us substantial help every year.
When I was in high school our physics teacher gave us a challenge that involved making a paper air plane of any shape. The only objective was to get it to fly as far as possible. I had some paper air plane making skills so I made the best plane I could and it flew pretty far. One guy made the greatest, yet simplest paper airplane of all time. He stood there at the starting line with a regular piece of paper. Some classmates scratched their head while silently chuckling to themselves. Moments later he took the flat piece of paper, crumpled it up, and threw it down the hall way. He beat the class with ease. Some of the students got mad and said that he cheated. The physics teacher said, "How so? I said it could be any shape; A paper ball is indeed a shape". He won the contest with flying colors. As Arthur Schopenhauer said: "Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see". I still regard this classmate as a genius.
A navy captain is alerted by his First Mate that there is a pirate ship coming towards his position. He asks a sailor to get him his red shirt.  The captain was asked, “Why do you need a red shirt?”. The Captain replies, “So that when I bleed, you guys don’t notice and aren’s discouraged”. They fight off the pirates eventually. The very next day, the Captain is alerted that 50 pirate ships are coming towards their boat. He yells, “Get me my brown pants!”
A couple going on vacation but his wife was on a business trip so he went to the destination first and his wife would meet him the next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick email. Unfortunately, when typing her address, he mistyped a letter and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher’s wife whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her email, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint. At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen: Dearest Wife, Just got checked in. Everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow. PS Sure is hot down here.
3 men died and went up to heaven. The guy at the gate said “The better you were to your wife, the better kind of car you’ll get”. The first guy was very loyal to his wife and got a Ferrari. The second man fought with his wife so he got a broken down car. The last guy cheated on his wife dozens of times so he got a scooter. One day the guy on the scooter saw the guy in the Ferrari crying. He asked him, “Why are you crying?”. He answered, “I just saw my wife on roller skates.”
In 1821, the Ottoman empire is occuping Greece. In the middle of one battle the Turks ran out of bullets and proposed to destroy the Acropolis to use the lead cores of its columns to make ammunition. When the Greeks got wind of this they gathered up their bullets and sent them to the Turks to use against themselves.
It is 1938. Walt Disney Studios are having a great success because of the release of the first feature-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. But women rights are not having so much success yet. Here's the answer to a woman's application. "Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen as that is performed entirely by young men", the letter explains. "The only work open to women consists of tracing the characters on clear celluloid sheets with Indian ink and filling in the tracings on the reverse side with point according to directions”. “However", as the letter goes on: "It would not be advisable to come to Hollywood with the above specifically in view, as there are really very few openings in comparison with the number of girls who apply."
My ex-boyfriend's mom had her eye make-up tattooed on, and sent her kids (who lived with her at the time) to the store for a couple of things. It wasn't until my ex and his brother were in the check-out line, receiving funny looks from the clerk, that he realized that they were two lone men buying nothing but cucumbers and vaseline (which his mom wanted to soothe the swelling from her eyes). My ex panics and blurts out, "No, it's okay, he's my brother!" while gesturing to his brother. They received major ಠ_ಠ faces. He just stopped talking, figured there was nothing he could do to salvage the situation, and just accepted the judgment.
We were flying to CA while I was breastfeeding our second daughter, Lucy. I had a bottle of breastmilk with me that the flight attendant graciously heated for me. I was standing in the galley and uncapped the bottle. Because of pressure some milk squirted out and sprayed a businessman waiting for the bathroom. It got on his hand. He shrugged, smiled and then LICKED IT OFF. He said, "Yum, just right!" and had no idea it was my breastmilk. I just about wet my pants. What a nice man!
I am a white american woman. I was engaged with an African-American man and I got pregnant. We broke up. I had many thoughts about whether keeping the baby or not. Many reasons were making me doubt about what to do. Especially, I am well aware about the prejuduces so common in the white american community in which I live. My son will be half-black. Prejudices around him will make his life hard and I won't be able to transmit him the beautiful African America culture that he should have access to. I'm sure his dad won't be able to raise him alone in another community. I decided to give him for adoption. The dad strongly disagrees. But I prefer him to live in a welcoming African-American family, rather than in my culture full stereotypes and hate.
There was a story of a little girl named Liza who was suffering from a disease and needed blood from her five-year-old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, “Yes, I’ll do it if it will save Liza”. As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, “Will I start to die right away?”. Being young, the boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give her all his blood. 
A curious child asked his mother: “Mommy, why are some of your hairs turning grey?”. The mother tried to use this occasion to teach her child: “It is because of you, dear: every bad action of yours will turn one of my hairs grey!”. The child replied innocently: “Now I know why grandmother has only grey hairs on her head.”
A woman went to the doctors office, where she was seen by one of the new doctors, but after about 4 minutes in the examination room, she burst out, screaming as she ran down the hall. An older doctor stopped her and asked what the problem was, and she told him her story. After listening, he had her sit down and told her to go relax in another room. The older doctor marched down hallway to the back where the first doctor was and demanded, "What's the matter with you? Mrs. Terry is 63 years old, she has four grown children and seven grandchildren, and you told her she was PREGNANT?". The new doctor continued to write on his clipboard and without looking up said, "Well, yes I did! But I bet her hiccups are gone now!"
My name is Alice Smith and I was sitting in the waiting room for my first appointment with a new dentist. I noticed his DDS diploma, which showed his full name. Suddenly, I remembered a tall, handsome, dark-haired boy with the same name who had been in my high school class some 40-odd years ago. Could this be the same guy that I had a secret crush on, way back then? Upon seeing him, however, I quickly discarded any such thought. This balding, grey-haired man with the deeply lined face was way too old to have been my classmate. After he examined my teeth, I asked him if he had attended Morgan Park High School. "Yes, Yes, I did; i'm a Mustang," he beamed with pride. "When did you graduate?" I asked. He answered, "In 1959, why do you ask?". "You were in my class!" I exclaimed. He looked at me closely. Then, that ugly, old, bald wrinkled, fat, grey, decrepit son-of-a-gun asked, "What did you teach?"
A wife was making a breakfast of fried eggs for her husband. Suddenly, her husband burst into the kitchen. "Careful," he said. "CAREFUL! put in some more butter! Oh my Goodness! You're cooking too many at once. TOO MANY! Turn them! TURN THEM NOW! We need more butter. Oh my GOD! WHERE are we going to get MORE BUTTER? They're going to STICK! Careful, CAREFUL! I said be CAREFUL! You NEVER listen to me when you're cooking! Never! Turn them! Hurry up! Are you CRAZY? Have you LOST your mind? Don't forget to salt them. You know you always forget to salt them. Use the salt. USE THE SALT! THE SALT!" The wife stared at him. "What in the world is wrong with you? You think I don't know how to fry a couple of eggs?" The husband calmly replied, "I just wanted to show you what it feels like when I'm driving."
There was a man who had worked all of his life and had saved all of his money. He was a real miser when it came to his money. He loved money more than just about anything. And just before he died, he said to his wife, "Now listen, when I die, I want you to take all my money and place it in the casket with me. I wanna take my money to the afterlife." So he got his wife to promise him with all her heart that when he died, she would put all the money in the casket with him. Well, one day he died. He was stretched out in the casket, and the wife was sitting there in black next to her closest friend. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said "Wait just a minute!". She had a shoe box with her. She came over with the box and placed it in the casket. Then the undertakers locked the casket down and rolled it away. Her friend said, "I hope you weren't crazy enough to put all that money in the casket." She said, "Yes, I promised. I'm a good person. I can't lie. I promised him that I was going to put that money in that casket with him." "You mean to tell me you put every cent of his money in the casket with him?" "I sure did," said the wife. "I got it all together, put it into my account and I wrote him a check."
A store that sells new husbands has just opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates. You may visit the store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the attributes of the men increase as the shopper ascends the flights. There is, however, a catch: you may choose any man from a particular floor, or you may choose to go up a floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building. So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1: These men have jobs. The second floor sign reads: Floor 2: These men have jobs and love kids. The third floor sign reads: Floor 3: These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking. "Wow," she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: Floor 4: These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead gorgeous and help with the housework. "Oh, mercy me!" she exclaims. "I can hardly stand it." Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: Floor 5: These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead gorgeous, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor and the sign reads: Floor 6: You are visitor number 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. Meanwhile, across the street, a new Wives Store has recently opened. The first floor has wives that love romance. The second floor has wives that love romance and have money. The third through sixth floors have never been visited..... 
Jack decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. They loaded up Jack's mini van and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night. "I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house." "Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light." The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing. About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend. He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, "Bob, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up North?" "Yes, I do." "Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?" "Yes," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to admit that I did." "And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name?" Bob's face turned red and he said, "Yeah, sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did. Why do you ask?" "She just died and left me everything." (And you thought the ending would be different, didn't you?)
Marty wakes up at home with a huge hangover. He forces himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins and a glass of water on the side table. He sits down and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. Marty looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotless, clean. So is the rest of the house. He takes the aspirins and notices a note on the table. "Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to go shopping. Love You!" So he goes to the kitchen and sure enough there is a hot breakfast and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating. Marty asks, "Son, what happened last ! night?" His son says, "Well, you came home around 3 AM, drunk and delirious. Broke some furniture, puked in the hallway, and gave yourself a black eye when you stumbled into the door." Confused, Marty asks, "So, why is everything in order and so clean, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me?" His son replies, "Oh, that! Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when she tried to take your pants off, you said, "Lady, leave me alone! I'm married!" Self-induced hangover -- $100.00. Broken furniture -- $2,000.00. Breakfast -- $10.00. Saying The Right Thing While Drunk -- PRICELESS
An old Indian chief sat in his hut on the reservation, smoking a ceremonial pipe and eyeing two Canadian government officials sent to interview him. "Chief Two Eagles," asked one official, "You have observed the white man for 90 years. You've seen his material wealth. You've seen his progress. You've seen his wars." The chief nodded in agreement. The official continued, "Considering all these events, in your opinion, where did the white man go wrong?". The chief stared at the government officials for over a minute and then calmly replied, "When white man found the land, Indians were running it. No taxes, no debt, plenty buffalo, plenty beaver, women did all the work, medicine man free, Indian man spent all day hunting and fishing, all night with his wife." The chief leaned back and smiled, ............... "Only white man dumb enough to think he could improve system like that."
When John found out he was going to inherit a fortune when his sickly father died, he decided he needed a woman to enjoy it with. So one evening he went to a singles bar where he spotted the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Her natural beauty took his breath away. "I may look like just an ordinary man," he said as he walked up to her, "but in just a week or two, my father will die, and I'll inherit 20 million dollars." Impressed, the woman went home with him that evening and, three days later she became his stepmother. Women are so much smarter than men. 
One day my mother was out and my dad was in charge of me. I was maybe 2 1/2 years old and had just recovered from an accident. Someone had given me a little 'tea set' as a get-well gift and it was one of my favorite toys. Daddy was in the living room engrossed in the evening news when I brought Daddy a little cup of "tea," which was just water. After several cups of tea and lots of praise for such yummy tea, my Mom came home. My Dad made her wait in the living room to watch me bring him a cup of tea, because it was "just the cutest thing!" My Mom waited, and sure enough, here I come down the hall with a cup of tea for Daddy and she watched him drink it up. Then she says, (as only a mother would know . . ... ) "Did it ever occur to you that the only place she can reach to get water is the toilet?"
Yesterday I was buying a large bag of Dog Chow for Socks the wonder dog and was about to check out.A woman behind me asked if I had a dog. What did she think I had, an elephant? I'm retired now, with some spare time on my hands. So, on impulse, I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, and that I was starting the Dog Food Diet again. Although I probably shouldn't, because I'd ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.I told her that it was essentially the perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Dog Chow nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry and that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try the diet again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story.) Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no. I stepped off a curb to sniff an Irish Setter and a car hit us both. I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack, he was laughing so hard! The manager won't let me shop there anymore....
"What's the loveliest sight in the world?" Ginevra wrote to her mother; but the letter got misplaced..and kept circulating box-to-box....days after days. Twenty-five years later as she cradled her newborn daughter in her arms, Ginevra recieved an old, faded letter containing only two words :"Your child."
Her husband pushed her after taking her to a height, despite her continuous pleading and requests. She ended up enjoying a swing for the first time and wondered why was she ever scared of it.  :)
The little kid had to stay in jail for quite a while, only to see his house burned down after his release. Well the Monopoly board game can get a little tricky at times.
She cried out his name, please, come back. You forgot your bullshit.
Their love was different. She was happy every time he kicked her in the stomach. Every time he kicked she loved him more. It was the love of a pregnant mother and her unborn son.
