I was 14, and walking home from school. A well-dressed man who looked like he was in his early 20s was walking towards me. I was lost in my own thoughts when I was walking, and as our paths crossed, he reached out and groped my chest. The moment this happened, I was confused for a second and stood frozen to the ground, not knowing how to react. I wheeled back, only to see the guy walking away casually, sniggering. He didn't even run, because he assumed I wouldn't do much. I threw my only weapon, a 500 ml nearly-empty plastic water bottle aimed straight for his head. My aim being so excellent, it went a few metres past his head, and he ended up tripping on the bottle, falling to the ground. I ran up to him, landed good kicks in his groin, screamed, called for help. Some people stopped their cars, asked me if I was alright, landed punches on him, verbally abused him, and even offered him advice. He ended up in tears and apologized. People talked me out of filing an FIR because they said it would be a hassling affair. I believed it and moved on. One less pervert in the world.
I had a friend who worked as a flight attendant and she got into a mild argument with a guy who insisted on having EVERYTHING that was free or complimentary on the flight. He was highly annoying and constantly asked crew for stuff. If he saw someone next to him get something, he wanted it too. At one point during the flight a lady asked for a sanitary pad to help her with an 'emergency' situation. He insisted he should have one too - cos you know, it's free, right? My friend tried to reason with him. I'm not sure if his English was 100%, because he insisted again and seemed to assume the pad was one of these... A sleep mask.??? Upon receiving his sanitary pad he proceeded to peel the paper backing off and expose the sticky side; he stuck the thing over his eyes and soon afterwards fell asleep... THE END.
